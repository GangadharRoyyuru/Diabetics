# Diabetics
I have used Pima Indians Diabetes Data set downloaded from kaggle. The data set contains 9 columns or varialbles. All the people in the study are females and are above 21 years of age. The data set contains 9 columns namely, Pregnancies, Glucose,Blood pressure(mm Hg), Skin thickness(mm), Insulin, BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age and class(0 - they dint have diabetes, 1 they have diabetes). 
After downloading the data set, and after the initial data cleaning I have used regression techique logistics regression and Decision Tree classifier. 
I have also found the correlation of the individual variables with the outcome.
Variables that influence the outcome in decreasing order are:
1. Glucose level 2. Body Mass Index 3. Age 4. Number of Pregnecies 5. DiabetesPedigreeFunction 6. Insulin 7. skin thickness 8. Blood Pressure
